# Webhooks

Push every completed debate's decision to your own systems, Telegram, Slack, Discord, or any HTTPS endpoint. Useful for getting notified on a phone while an overnight analysis runs, logging decisions to a spreadsheet for backtesting later, or bridging the analysis output to your own broker via a small script.

**Trading Agents Lab does not execute trades.** Webhooks are an analysis handoff. They push the JSON decision payload to your receivers; if you want to act on it (e.g. place an order with your brokerage), your receiving script does that part with your own broker credentials, on the regulated platform. This is the locked-positioning firewall, your app, your auth, your responsibility.

## Where to configure

`Settings → Webhooks → + Add webhook`

Per-webhook you set:

- **Name**, anything human-readable, shown in the post-debate report
- **Kind**, Telegram, Slack, Discord, or Generic JSON
- **URL**, the webhook endpoint (treated as a secret; stored via OS keychain)
- **Chat ID** (Telegram only)
- **HMAC secret** (Generic only), sent as `X-TAL-Signature: sha256=<hex>`
- **Filter**, fire only on certain actions and/or above a confidence threshold

Filters are optional. Leave the action checkboxes empty + confidence slider at 0% to fire on every debate.

## Recipes

### Telegram (recommended for phone alerts)

1. On Telegram, message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), `/newbot`, follow the prompts. Save the **bot token** it gives you.
2. Message your new bot anything (it has to send first, you can't DM it cold).
3. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot), it replies with your numeric **chat ID**.
4. In TAL: `+ Add webhook` → Kind: **Telegram** → URL: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage` → Chat ID: your numeric ID.

For group chats: add the bot to the group, send a message in the group, then visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` in a browser to find the negative chat ID (e.g. `-100123456789`).

### Slack

1. In Slack: `Apps → Incoming Webhooks → Add to Slack → pick channel → save`. Slack gives you a webhook URL.
2. In TAL: Kind: **Slack** → paste the URL. No other fields needed.

### Discord

1. In a Discord server: `Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → pick channel → copy URL`.
2. In TAL: Kind: **Discord** → paste the URL.

### Generic (your own script / Cloudflare Worker / Lambda)

The payload shape is documented as `schema: tradingagentslab.webhook.v1`:

```json
{
  "schema": "tradingagentslab.webhook.v1",
  "event": "session.complete",
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "trade_date": "2026-05-15",
  "decision": {
    "action": "BUY",
    "confidence": 0.78,
    "reasoning": "..."
  },
  "session_id": "01923f...",
  "live": true,
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "estimated_cost_usd": 0.0042
}
```

Set an **HMAC shared secret** on the generic webhook to sign the body. Your receiver verifies by recomputing:

```python
import hmac, hashlib
sig = request.headers["X-TAL-Signature"].removeprefix("sha256=")
expected = hmac.new(SECRET.encode(), request.body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
if not hmac.compare_digest(sig, expected):
    return 403
```

### Bridge to your own broker (illustrative)

If you want TAL's analysis to trigger a real-money trade, write a thin receiver. Example as a Cloudflare Worker that forwards BUY decisions over a confidence threshold to your Alpaca Live or Interactive Brokers account using *your* credentials:

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env) {
    if (req.method !== 'POST') return new Response('only POST', { status: 405 });
    const body = await req.json<TalDecision>();

    // Filter is also enforced in TAL; this is belt-and-braces.
    if (body.decision.action !== 'BUY') return new Response('skip');
    if (body.decision.confidence < 0.75) return new Response('skip');

    // Place the order with YOUR brokerage credentials, not TAL's.
    await fetch('https://api.alpaca.markets/v2/orders', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'APCA-API-KEY-ID': env.ALPACA_KEY_ID,
        'APCA-API-SECRET-KEY': env.ALPACA_SECRET,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        symbol: body.ticker,
        qty: 1,
        side: 'buy',
        type: 'market',
        time_in_force: 'gtc',
      }),
    });
    return new Response('ok');
  },
};
```

The trade lives on Alpaca's books. TAL never sees your broker credentials and doesn't know whether you executed.

## Mechanics

- Webhooks fire **once per debate**, after `session.complete`, before the WebSocket closes.
- Each webhook gets a **5-second timeout**. Multiple webhooks fire in parallel, total wall-clock is roughly the slowest receiver.
- **No retry queue** in v1. If a receiver is down, it shows up as `failed` in the post-debate report and that's the end of it. Re-run the analysis if you care.
- Stub debates fire webhooks too. Handy for testing your receiver without burning provider quota.
- The post-debate **Webhooks** card on the Analyze page shows `fired`, `filtered`, or `failed` per receiver. URLs are never displayed, bot tokens stay private.

## Privacy

- Webhook URLs are stored via Electron's `safeStorage`, encrypted at rest by the OS keychain (Keychain on macOS, DPAPI on Windows, libsecret on Linux).
- URLs and HMAC secrets never appear in the engine's stderr logs.
- URLs never appear in the `webhook.report` event the renderer receives, so they never end up in History replays.

## What v1 doesn't do

- No retry queue. If a webhook fails, it fails for that debate.
- No batch / summary webhooks across multiple tickers, fires per single ticker. Multi-ticker batch runner is Phase 8b.
- No per-receiver custom payload template, Telegram/Slack/Discord get short-form text; Generic gets the full JSON. Phase 8b candidate.
- No scheduled / cron-style runs. Set this up via your own watchlist + cron + the engine HTTP API if you want morning auto-analysis today.
