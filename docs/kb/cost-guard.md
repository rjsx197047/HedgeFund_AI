# Cost Guard

*Stacked daily / weekly / monthly USD caps and an optional sessions-per-day rate cap. Optional. Off by default. Override per-run.*

## What it is

Cost Guard is a quota layer that sits in front of the live LLM debate. Before every paid-API session, the engine estimates the worst-case cost of the debate and checks it against the caps you've set. If the cost would push any cap over the limit, the request is blocked and a modal opens, you can either **Cancel** or **Override and run anyway**. The override is per-run; it does not raise the cap.

The four cap dimensions:

| Dimension | What it limits |
|---|---|
| **Daily** | USD spent across all debates that started today (UTC) |
| **Weekly** | USD spent across the rolling 7-day window |
| **Monthly** | USD spent across the rolling 30-day window |
| **Sessions per day** | Count of debates started today, regardless of cost |

A cap of `0` means **disabled**. You can enable any subset, e.g. monthly USD only, or sessions-per-day only.

## Why we built it

LLM costs scale with model choice + token usage in ways that are easy to underestimate. A single debate with gpt-5 or Claude Opus 4.7 across 12 agents can easily cost more than you'd expect. Cost Guard turns "did I just spend $20 on three debates?" into a deliberate decision rather than a billing surprise.

It also protects against accidental loops, runaway scripts, and the occasional UI glitch that fires multiple debates. The rate cap (sessions-per-day) catches what the USD cap might miss.

---

## Where to go in the UI

**Settings → Cost Guard**.

Top of the page: a **status row** showing your current spend totals (daily / weekly / monthly USD, sessions today) with color bars indicating how close you are to each cap. Green = below 50%, amber = 50-90%, red = 90%+.

Below that: an **Enable / Disable** toggle and a form with four numeric inputs (one per cap dimension). Caps update via PUT on save. Settings can be changed at any time, including mid-session.

---

## What counts as spend?

The engine computes a per-session cost using a static **cost rate table** (`engine/llm_providers.py`). Rates are USD per million input/output tokens, refreshed manually when providers change them. Conservative numbers preferred.

| Provider / Auth | Cost behavior |
|---|---|
| API-key on any per-token-billed provider | Real token usage × rate table. Logged on `session.complete`. |
| **OpenAI OAuth** (ChatGPT subscription) | **$0**. Subscription billing happens outside our app; we record 0 so the cost ledger only reflects per-token API spend. |
| **Local LLM** (Ollama / LM Studio) | **$0**. Local sessions cost nothing in real dollars. |
| **OpenRouter** | Recorded as `0.0` since model rates vary by underlying model and we don't track them. The rate cap (sessions-per-day) is what you'd use to discipline OpenRouter usage. |

OAuth and Local sessions **skip** the three USD caps but **do count** against the sessions-per-day rate cap, even free runs benefit from quota discipline on runaway debate counts.

## The pre-debate reservation flow

Before a live debate kicks off, the renderer:

1. **Estimates worst-case cost** for the session (assumes every agent maxes out its output budget, transcript grows triangularly across agents).
2. **POSTs `/cost-guard/reserve`** with `{model, auth_kind, max_tokens}`.
3. If the reservation succeeds → the debate proceeds with a `reservation_id` threaded on the WebSocket start frame.
4. If the reservation fails with `CostGuardBlocked` → the **Cost Guard modal** opens.

The modal shows:
- Which dimension would be exceeded (daily / weekly / monthly / rate)
- Your current spend in that dimension
- The configured cap
- The estimated cost of the requested run

You then choose:
- **Cancel**, the debate aborts. No tokens spent.
- **Override and run anyway**, the renderer re-reserves with `override=true`. The session runs, and the cost is added to the rolling totals just like any other run. **The cap itself does not change.**

A three-second anti-tamper countdown disables the Override button on first appearance so you can't accidentally double-click through it. The Cancel button is always enabled.

## The TOCTOU-safe reservation

Cost Guard uses a **time-of-check-to-time-of-use safe** reservation pattern: the database insert of the reservation row is the atomic check. Two simultaneous debates cannot both squeeze under the same cap, the first to insert wins; the second sees the bumped totals and gets blocked.

Reservations have a **15-minute TTL**. If a debate ends cleanly, the reservation is finalized with real token usage replacing the worst-case estimate. If the renderer crashes mid-debate, the reservation expires and the slot frees up. A background sweeper cleans expired reservations on every state read.

## When to use which cap

Tune to your risk tolerance:

- **Strict daily cap (e.g. $1/day)**, pairs well with `gpt-4o-mini`/`claude-haiku-4-5` and frequent experimentation. ~200 debates/day at this budget.
- **Monthly cap only (e.g. $30/month)**, pairs with mixed-model use; lets you have expensive days as long as the month averages out.
- **Sessions-per-day cap (e.g. 20)**, disciplines OAuth + Local users where USD caps don't fire. Also a sane secondary cap alongside USD limits.
- **All four enabled**, paranoid mode. Useful for long-running unattended scenarios.

---

## What does NOT count as spend

- **Stub debates** (no provider configured), never charged. They run for free against the canned content.
- **OAuth debates**, subscription billing is out-of-band. We record $0.
- **Local LLM debates**, $0.
- **Failed sessions**, if the LLM provider errors before any tokens are spent, the reservation is finalized at 0.

## Reading the spend bars

The status row at the top of the Cost Guard tab shows each cap dimension as a bar. The bar color reflects "how close are you to this cap":

| Color | % of cap used | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | 0-49% | Plenty of headroom. |
| 🟡 Amber | 50-89% | You're past halfway. Next runs may push you near the limit. |
| 🔴 Red | 90-100% | You're at or above the cap. Next live debate will be blocked. |

For unset caps (value = 0 / disabled), the bar shows the raw spend with no fill, just a number, no progress visualization.

## Resetting spend

Spend totals are **rolling windows**, not user-resettable values. They automatically roll forward as time passes:

- Daily totals reset at **00:00 UTC**.
- Weekly totals shed entries older than 7 days each midnight.
- Monthly totals shed entries older than 30 days each midnight.

There is **no manual reset**, by design, so spend history can't be wiped to dodge a cap. If you need to forget historical data entirely, you can delete `<userData>/data/sessions.db` (or specifically the `sessions` table). This is destructive and not recommended; debate history is the same DB.

---

## Tracking historical spend

The History page shows per-session `estimated_cost_usd` next to each entry. Sort by date or by cost to see what your expensive runs were. This is independent of the Cost Guard windows, History never expires.

## Engine API surface

For developers integrating against the engine:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /cost-guard/state` | Current spend + config |
| `PUT /cost-guard/config` | Update caps + enable/disable |
| `POST /cost-guard/check` | Dry-run: would this debate be blocked? |
| `POST /cost-guard/reserve` | Atomic check + reservation; returns `reservation_id` or 402 `CostGuardBlocked` |

Full request/response shapes in [docs/api.md](../api.md).
