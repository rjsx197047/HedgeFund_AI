# TradingAgentsLab, Knowledge Base

*Entry point for users of TradingAgentsLab: what it is, how to set it up, and how to get the most out of it.*

TradingAgentsLab is an open-source desktop application for educational market research and paper trading. It runs a panel of AI analyst agents, technical, fundamental, news, and sentiment, that debate a ticker on a date you specify, then converge on a BUY / SELL / HOLD recommendation. The analysis is for research and paper-trading purposes only. It is not investment advice.

TradingAgentsLab is a standalone trading companion for Clawless. You can use it independently; connecting it to a running Clawless instance is optional and adds gateway routing for LLM calls.

> **For educational research and paper trading. This is not investment advice.**
