# TradingAgentsLab Engine API

> **Audience:** Claude or human picking up the engine sidecar contract cold. Used by `desktop/src/lib/engine-client.ts` from the renderer; no other clients exist yet.

The engine is a FastAPI sidecar bound to `127.0.0.1:<random-port>` with a per-process bearer token. The Electron main process spawns it on `app.whenReady` and parses `{port, token}` from the first stdout line. Every endpoint requires bearer auth. The renderer obtains the bearer via the `tradingAgentsLab.getEngineHandshake()` contextBridge.

If anything in this doc disagrees with `engine/server.py`, treat the source as authoritative and update this doc.

## Authentication

| Transport | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| HTTP | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every request. 401 otherwise. |
| WebSocket | `?token=<token>` query parameter (browsers can't set headers on `WebSocket`). Server closes with code `1008 invalid token` on mismatch before `accept()`. |

CORS is configured for renderer origin `http://localhost:5173` (and `http://127.0.0.1:5173`). WebSocket is not subject to CORS but is harmlessly covered.

## HTTP endpoints

### `GET /health`

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "uptime_seconds": 12.4,
  "engine_state": "ready",
  "data_provider": "yfinance",
  "live_supported": true,
  "live_default_model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "storage_path": "/Users/jay/Projects/TradingAgents/data/sessions.db"
}
```

`engine_state` describes engine *capability*, not the most recent session: it is `"ready"` whenever the server is up. Whether a given session ran a stub or a live debate is reported per-session in the `session.complete` event (see WS contract below). `data_provider` reports the active `BaseDataProvider.name`. `live_supported` indicates the engine can run real-LLM debates when given a `provider_config`. `live_default_model` is the cost-cheap default the engine assumes when a `provider_config` arrives without an explicit `model` field. `storage_path` reports where the engine writes persisted sessions — `<repo>/data/sessions.db` by default, overridable via the `TAL_SESSIONS_DB` env var.

### `GET /data/summary?ticker=<X>&trade_date=<YYYY-MM-DD>`

Returns a compact view of recent OHLCV data anchored on `trade_date`. Response shape (`QuoteSummary` in `engine/data_providers.py`):

```json
{
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "trade_date": "2026-05-08",
  "as_of": "2026-05-07",
  "last_close": 211.5,
  "period_open": 177.16,
  "period_high": 216.83,
  "period_low": 173.66,
  "period_change_pct": 19.38,
  "avg_volume": 147571146.0,
  "sessions": 24,
  "source": "yfinance"
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Summary available |
| 404 | `DataUnavailable` — provider returned no rows (unknown ticker, all-future date range, etc.) |
| 502 | Other provider error (network, rate limit, parse failure) |

### `GET /data/news?ticker=<X>&limit=<N>` (default `limit=5`, range `[1, 20]`)

```json
{
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "source": "yfinance",
  "headlines": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "publisher": "Yahoo Finance Video",
      "pub_date": "2026-05-07T21:04:15Z",
      "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/...",
      "summary": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Empty `headlines` list is a valid 200 response — never 404. 502 on provider errors.

### `POST /analyze`

Phase 2/3 stub — returns a deterministic HOLD decision regardless of input.

```jsonc
// Request
{ "ticker": "NVDA", "trade_date": "2026-05-08" }

// Response
{
  "ok": true,
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "trade_date": "2026-05-08",
  "decision": {
    "action": "HOLD",
    "confidence": 0.5,
    "reasoning": "Stub response — engine not yet connected to tradingagents core."
  },
  "agents": []
}
```

Live-LLM `POST /analyze` is intentionally not wired today: the streaming WS path is the canonical entrypoint for real debates, and supports `provider_config`. A one-shot `POST /analyze` that ran an OpenAI session would burn ~$0.005 per request without giving the user the streaming UX. When/if a non-streaming caller appears, this endpoint will accept the same `provider_config` shape as the WS start frame.

### `GET /sessions?limit=<N>&ticker=<X>`

Lists recently-completed debates, newest first. `limit` defaults to 50 (max 500). `ticker` is optional and case-insensitive. Returns a list of *summaries* — no event payload, no transcript. Use `GET /sessions/{id}` to inflate one.

```jsonc
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "019e0a0e95c1-8403736e",     // ULID-like, lexicographically sortable
      "ticker": "NVDA",
      "trade_date": "2026-05-08",
      "decision_action": "HOLD",
      "decision_confidence": 0.55,
      "decision_reasoning": "...",
      "live": false,                     // false for stub, true for real-LLM
      "model": null,                     // populated when live
      "input_tokens": null,
      "output_tokens": null,
      "estimated_cost_usd": null,
      "created_at": "2026-05-09T00:06:28Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /sessions/{id}`

Returns the full detail for a single session, including the inflated `events` array (every WS event the renderer received during the original stream). Used by the History detail view to replay a past debate.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "019e0a0e95c1-8403736e",
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "trade_date": "2026-05-08",
  "decision_action": "HOLD",
  "decision_confidence": 0.55,
  "decision_reasoning": "...",
  "live": true,
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "input_tokens": 7401,
  "output_tokens": 2384,
  "estimated_cost_usd": 0.0025,
  "created_at": "2026-05-09T00:06:28Z",
  "events": [
    { "type": "session.start", "ticker": "NVDA", "trade_date": "2026-05-08" },
    { "type": "data.summary", "...": "..." },
    { "type": "agent.message", "agent": "technical_analyst", "...": "..." },
    "..."
  ]
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Session found |
| 404 | No session with that id |

### `DELETE /sessions/{id}`

Deletes a single session row. Returns `{"deleted": true, "id": "..."}` on success, 404 if the id doesn't exist. CORS-allowed for the renderer origin (`DELETE` is in the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` list).

### Session persistence model

Persistence is **strictly post-stream**: the engine captures the WS event sequence in memory while it streams, and writes a single SQLite row only after `session.complete` is sent (and only when one is sent — aborted streams via the renderer's Stop button do *not* persist). Failures to write are logged to stderr and silently ignored — the user already saw the debate, so persistence is best-effort, not contract.

Storage backend: SQLite at `<repo>/data/sessions.db` with WAL mode + `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL`. Override the path with the `TAL_SESSIONS_DB` env var. The DB file is gitignored. Schema version 1; older schemas are upgraded in place by `_ensure_initialized()`, newer schemas refuse to write (the engine will refuse to clobber a file from a future version).

## WebSocket endpoint

### `WS /stream?token=<token>`

Bidirectional channel for streaming the multi-agent debate.

**Client opens, sends a start frame, server streams events, server closes 1000.** No keepalive ping/pong is in scope for v1.

#### Client → server: start frame

Sent by the client immediately after `open`:

```jsonc
{
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "trade_date": "2026-05-08",
  // Optional. When present, the engine runs a real-LLM debate via the
  // configured provider; when absent, it runs the canned stub debate.
  "provider_config": {
    "provider": "openai",        // currently the only allowlisted value
    "api_key": "sk-…",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",      // optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
    "max_tokens": 400            // optional, defaults to 400, hard cap
  }
}
```

The server reads exactly one start frame, then becomes write-only. If `provider` is not in the allowlist, the engine falls through to the stub path rather than erroring — this lets the renderer ship UI-side support for new providers ahead of engine-side wiring.

#### Server → client: event stream

Each line is a JSON object with a `type` discriminator. Order is deterministic.

##### 1. `session.start`

```json
{ "type": "session.start", "ticker": "NVDA", "trade_date": "2026-05-08" }
```

##### 2. `data.summary` (best-effort, omitted if data fetch fails)

Same shape as the `GET /data/summary` body, with a `type: "data.summary"` discriminator added.

##### 3. `news.headlines` (best-effort, omitted if no headlines)

Same shape as `GET /data/news` body, with `type: "news.headlines"` discriminator added.

##### 4. `agent.message` × N

```json
{
  "type": "agent.message",
  "agent": "technical_analyst",
  "phase": "analysts",
  "content": "[STUB · yfinance] ..."
}
```

Phase canonical values: `"analysts" | "researchers" | "trader" | "risk"`. Agents inside each phase, in order:

| Phase | Agents |
|---|---|
| `analysts` | `technical_analyst`, `fundamental_analyst`, `news_analyst`, `sentiment_analyst` |
| `researchers` | `bull_researcher`, `bear_researcher`, `research_manager` |
| `trader` | `trader` |
| `risk` | `risk_aggressive`, `risk_conservative`, `risk_neutral`, `portfolio_manager` |

##### 5. `phase.transition`

```json
{ "type": "phase.transition", "from": "analysts", "to": "researchers" }
```

Emitted between phases.

##### 6. `session.complete`

```jsonc
{
  "type": "session.complete",
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "trade_date": "2026-05-08",
  "decision": {
    "action": "HOLD",   // BUY | SELL | HOLD
    "confidence": 0.55, // 0..1
    "reasoning": "..."
  },
  // Live-only fields — present when the session ran via a real LLM.
  // Stub-mode session.complete carries only the four fields above.
  "live": true,
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "input_tokens": 7401,
  "output_tokens": 2384,
  "estimated_cost_usd": 0.0025
}
```

When `provider_config` was supplied in the start frame, the engine populates `live`, `model`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, and `estimated_cost_usd`. The renderer uses these to render a "Live · model" badge on the decision card and to log a per-session cost estimate. Cost is calculated using local rate tables (`engine/live_debate.py:_COST_PER_M_TOKENS`) and is **never** authoritative — it's a budgeting hint, not a billing record.

##### Server close

Server calls `ws.close(code=1000)` after `session.complete` is sent. The renderer also treats `1005` (no-status) as clean for edge timing where the server's close frame isn't observed before the socket teardown.

#### Cancellation

Client can call `WebSocket.close()` at any time; the server's `WebSocketDisconnect` handler returns cleanly without further frames. The renderer's `streamDebate()` wrapper exposes a `{close, done}` handle for this.

## Process model

### Spawn (Electron main → engine)

```
$REPO/desktop/electron/engine-runner.ts
  spawn("$REPO/engine/.venv/bin/python", ["-m", "engine"], { cwd: "$REPO" })
  └── child.stdout — first line is JSON {port, token}; subsequent lines are uvicorn logs
  └── child.stderr — uvicorn logs (teed to main process console with [engine] prefix)
```

`cwd: $REPO` is required so `python -m engine` resolves the `engine` package via `sys.path[0]`.

### Handshake (renderer → main → engine)

The Electron main process awaits `child.stdout.once('data')`, parses it once, and caches the resulting `Promise<EngineHandshake>`. The renderer fetches the cached handshake via the IPC channel `engine:get-handshake`, so the renderer never sees uvicorn's logs.

### Teardown

`stopEngine()` is called from `before-quit` and `window-all-closed`. It sends `SIGTERM` to the child. uvicorn handles the signal and shuts down the asyncio loop cleanly.

## Smoke test

`tools/dev-smoke.sh [TICKER] [TRADE_DATE]` runs all the above contract checks end-to-end without involving Electron or the renderer. Use it to rule the backend out when the UI isn't streaming, or as a fresh-session sanity check after a reboot.

## Out of scope (intentional gaps)

- Multi-provider live debates — only OpenAI is wired today (`provider: "openai"`). Anthropic / DeepSeek / OpenRouter land when their wiring is added; the renderer can ship UI ahead of engine support because unsupported providers fall through to the stub.
- Token-level streaming — each agent's full response is sent as a single `agent.message` event. Token-by-token streaming is a future protocol upgrade and would gate on a `agent.message.delta` event variant.
- Cross-session search / export / sharing — persistence is per-row only. Future.
- Authentication beyond bearer — sidecar is `127.0.0.1`-bound; no remote callers.
- Rate limiting / quotas — `max_tokens` and `MAX_AGENTS_PER_SESSION` are the only hard caps. The engine logs estimated cost per session to stderr, and the renderer surfaces it on the decision card; there is no enforced spend ceiling beyond the per-call cap.
- Versioned protocol — single canonical version today. When it changes, the start frame will gain a `protocol_version` field and the server will reject mismatches with close code `1008`.
