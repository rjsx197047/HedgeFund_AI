# tools/upstream-check.sh — report whether we're caught up with upstream
# TauricResearch/TradingAgents.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/upstream-check.sh           # network fetch + report
#   bash tools/upstream-check.sh --offline # report against last cached fetch
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  fully caught up
#   1  behind upstream — review needed
#   2  upstream remote not configured
#
# This script does NOT merge or modify the working tree. It only fetches
# and reports. Merging upstream is a deliberate review step (see CLAUDE.md
# §4 — upstream merges may touch agent prompts, decision parser, role
# definitions wrapped by engine/live_debate.py, so a regression sweep is
# required after any merge).
