# TradingAgentsLab — Handover

> **Purpose:** Session-to-session context bridge. If you (Claude or human) are picking this up cold, read this first. Status by phase in [`backlog.md`](backlog.md). Chronological session log in [`WORKLOG.md`](WORKLOG.md). Detailed design in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). Orchestration rules in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## What this project is

**TradingAgentsLab** — github.com/RBJGlobal/TradingAgentsLab. AGPL-3.0 fork of Tauric Research's TradingAgents (multi-agent LLM trading research framework). Positioned as the **"standalone trading companion for Clawless"**.

**Connection, not integration.** TradingAgentsLab connects to Clawless the same way it connects to Alpaca or Yahoo Finance — one of N optional connectors. **No code inheritance from Clawless.** No shared CSS, no copied components. Brand-level coherence achieved through independent design.

**Posture:** open-source educational lab + paper trading. Never recommend real-money trading.

**Owner:** Junaid Siddiqi, founder. Treats Claude as principal developer/architect for TradingAgentsLab.

## Where we are right now (as of 2026-05-23, end of day, wrap-up complete)

### Headline

**Engine + desktop stability sprint shipped (Tier 0), plus the branded FlowStage chart wrapper on the site.** Two clean workstreams, both merged/pushed.

### Today (2026-05-23)

**Thread 1 — Tier 0 stability hardening (app repo).** Ran a 3-agent audit (engine resilience, Electron/renderer resilience, test safety net), then implemented seven crash/hang/cost-cap fixes on a branch, with tests, verified end to end, and merged via PR #1.
- **`ce04eca`** = merge commit on `origin/main`. Squashes in `c97e601` (the Tier 0 fix). `stability-tier0` branch deleted.
- Fixes: React `ErrorBoundary` around `<App/>` (recoverable blank-screen); LLM request timeouts (cloud 90s / **local 600s** split — the smoke proved local large-model inference legitimately exceeds 90s); Telegram debates now take a global `cost_guard.reserve()`/finalize (they were bypassing the USD caps entirely — real money hole); WS `ticker=""` pre-bind (NameError on early disconnect); `fetchWithTimeout` on 14 unguarded renderer calls; atomic Telegram JSON writes; SQLite `busy_timeout=5000`.
- Verified: engine **187 pytest** (+4 new), `dev-smoke.sh` 17/17, desktop type-check + build clean, and a **real 12-agent local Ollama debate** end to end (BUY@0.80, reservation finalized).
- **Follow-up logged (Tier 2, not done):** persist bot sessions so spend survives a debate outliving the 15-min reservation TTL. Also Tiers 1–4 from the audit remain (engine respawn/watchdog, WS reconnect, retry/backoff, secrets recovery, live_debate failure-path tests, renderer unit tests).

**Thread 2 — Branded FlowStage wrapper (site repo).** Implemented the RBJ Global family "stage" treatment (amber translation of ClaudeLink's MeshStage) on the `/flow` chart per a recipe relayed from Global Sites Developer.
- **Site `bed572f`** pushed to `origin/main`. New `components/flow/FlowStage.tsx` (4 layers: dark radial gradient + amber glow, masked grid, logo watermark, brand lockup), wraps `<ReactFlow>` (transparent canvas), drops the old `<Background>`.
- **Removed `hideAttribution`** — we hold no React Flow Pro license, so the badge must stay visible. Restyled it in `globals.css` (transparent bg, faint 9px link) so it blends instead of showing as a gray box (founder caught the gray box; fixed).
- Verified live in DOM at desktop + mobile.

**Cross-product / coordination:**
- **Discovered Global Sites Developer edits the SAME local `Trading_agent_site` tree + `.git` concurrently.** Handled safely (committed only my files by explicit path, pushed exact sha `bed572f:main`). His SEO commit **`045e39b`** (16 docs meta descriptions, 25 canonicals, SoftwareApplication JSON-LD, Bing resubmit) fast-forwarded on top. Both deploying via Cloudflare. Memory: `reference_shared_tree_concurrency.md`.
- **SEO is now fully Global Sites Developer's** (founder decision). CLAUDE.md §6 updated.
- **AlgoWave** (separate sibling product, `/Users/junaidsiddiqi/algowave`): reviewed 2026-05-22, advised reopen as backtest+paper v1.0. Founder deferred to next week or the week after. `REOPEN_PLAN.md` punch-list still owed before the dev starts. Memory: `project_algowave_sibling.md`.
- Registered on ClaudeLink as role **Trading Agents Lab Developer**.

### Live state at session end

- **App `main` at `ce04eca`** (Tier 0 merged). Local main synced, `stability-tier0` branch deleted.
- **Site `main` at `045e39b`** (GSD SEO) → `bed572f` (FlowStage). Cloudflare auto-deploying both.
- **No dev processes running** — engine smoke was transient subprocesses; local `serve` on :4324 killed; ports free.
- **Inbox clear.** GSD's final FYI (SEO pushed) read; no replies pending.

### Open items carried forward

1. **Tier 1–4 stability** (audit backlog): engine respawn/watchdog + handshake timeout, WS reconnect, retry/backoff for Gemini/Codex/OpenRouter/local, corrupt-secrets recovery, PID-file orphan cleanup (also fixes `pkill -f` killing the dev engine), and tests: `test_live_debate.py` failure paths + renderer vitest + `test_storage.py`. Plus the Tier-2 "persist bot sessions" item.
2. **AlgoWave `REOPEN_PLAN.md`** — write before the dedicated dev starts (~next week+). Merge hook: TradingAgents debate → AlgoWave's `SignalScorer` (`MLModel` Protocol).
3. **Phase 6 Clawless gateway tap** and the older v1.1 review backlog items still queued.

### First moves next session

1. Check inbox (`mcp__claudelink__read_inbox`; already registered as Trading Agents Lab Developer).
2. Verify dev stack OFF.
3. Founder's queue — likely Tier 1 stability, or the AlgoWave plan doc, or Phase 6.

## Previous state (as of 2026-05-21, end of day, wrap-up complete)

### Headline

**Phase 8c bidirectional Telegram bot is fully shipped to main.** Multi-day arc starting 2026-05-18 (MVP) → 2026-05-19 (v1.1) → 2026-05-20-21 (v1.2 + v1.3). Latest TAL main: `122c12a`. Site has gained an interactive React Flow visualization (`/flow`), a dedicated Telegram section on `/tour`, a homepage "Run a Diligence from anywhere" callout, and a ClaudeLink sibling card on `/family`. Latest site main: `163d81c`.

### Today (2026-05-21) — Telegram polish + interactive flow + ClaudeLink family rollout

Long day, three threads:

**Thread 1: Telegram v1.2 + v1.3 ship-out.** Founder dogfooded the MVP via Telegram, gave feedback per session, each piece landed on the same branch then merged to main as one bundle:
- Channels tab (Telegram moves out of Webhooks into its own dedicated Settings tab; the operator's mental model now matches the code)
- Full-debate streaming with per-chat `/full` and `/summary` slash commands, persisted to `telegram_chat_modes.json` so user mode survives engine restart
- OAuth-for-bot plumbing (lifted the API-key-only limitation; renderer pushes fresh OpenAI OAuth tokens to a new `/telegram/refresh-credentials` engine endpoint every 45 minutes so access tokens never expire mid-bot)
- `setMyCommands` so typing `/` in Telegram pops the autocomplete menu with 6 commands and descriptions
- Persistent reply keyboard (2x2 grid: Full debate mode / Summary mode / Current mode / Help) with friendly-label normalization back to slash commands
- Wording fix: `/start` from an already-allowlisted user now returns "Trading Agents Lab is ready. Mode: *summary*. ..." instead of the awkward "You're already approved" (founder voice feedback)
- All merged in one go: TAL main `122c12a`. 183 engine tests + 43 telegram-specific pass.

**Thread 2: Interactive React Flow on the marketing site.** Founder asked about "Claude Design" (real product, launched 2026-04-17, Anthropic Labs); confirmed via web search but determined it's a Figma/Canva-style standalone-visual generator, not the right fit for embedded interactive React in our Next.js codebase. See `project_claude_design.md` memory.

Built `/flow` with `@xyflow/react` v12. Twelve agent nodes in four swim-lane columns (Analysts / Researchers / Trader / Risk + Decision) with auto-loop playback, click-to-detail side panel, locked canvas (no pan, no zoom — the diagram is a visual, not a workspace). Refined per founder review (per-column header positions to fix label overlap, removed React Flow's default controls panel that clashed with dark theme). Discoverable via homepage "See the flow live" CTA + sitemap. Live at `/flow/` (site `e16f6c5`). Technical notes captured in `reference_xyflow_react_notes.md` memory for any other family site (the Global Sites Developer is now building a mesh viz on `claudelink.ai` with the same stack).

**Thread 3: ClaudeLink reciprocal on `/family` + `llms.txt`.** Global Sites Developer FYI'd that `claudelink.ai` is now a full RBJ Global family member; added the reciprocal SiblingCard + JSON-LD subOrganization entry on our `/family` page, and one new line in our `llms.txt` Family section. Bundled with the React Flow push (site `163d81c`). Reply sent to Global Sites Developer with React Flow technical answers for their mesh-viz prototype.

**Cross-product:**
- **WhisprDesk SIGTERM issue from 2026-05-21 morning was traced to environmental.** Static audit on both sides ruled out any cross-app kill path in the codebases. WhisprDesk dev confirmed the timing (TAL Electron start at 23:30:14 = WhisprDesk SIGTERM at exitCode 15) but the kill is coming from the founder's launch workflow (a shell script he runs as "restart TAL"), not from either codebase. Founder is investigating his own script on his side. Nothing for us to fix.
- **Cross-product family graph now consistent.** All five sibling sites + ClaudeLink reference each other correctly in JSON-LD, llms.txt, and footer collapse links.

```

### Live state at session end

- **Dev stack: KILLED.** Both site dev server (`npm run dev` on :3000) and TAL desktop dev stack killed. Zero processes from either repo running. Confirmed via `lsof -ti:3000`, `lsof -ti:5173`, and `ps`.
- **TAL main is at `122c12a`.** Phase 8c fully shipped. `phase-8c-v1.2-oauth-and-full` branch still exists locally + remotely; safe to delete on founder's call. `phase-8c-telegram-bot` and `phase-8c-v1.1-enhancements` branches similarly safe to prune.
- **Site main is at `163d81c`.** Cloudflare auto-deployed. All four of today's pushes are live.
- **Inbox clear.** Two FYI replies sent today (Global Sites Developer on ClaudeLink family entry + React Flow technical notes); no responses expected.

### Open items carried into tomorrow

**Quick wins (~30 min each):**

1. **Delete merged Phase 8c branches** (`phase-8c-telegram-bot`, `phase-8c-v1.1-enhancements`, `phase-8c-v1.2-oauth-and-full`) on founder's call.
2. **iluvmd.com footer add** (from 2026-05-17 iLoveMD dev ask, still queued).
3. **Refresh `/tour` desktop screenshots** if any UI changed since the original 2026-05-09 captures (some Settings panels may have minor v1.0 / v1.1 / v1.2 drift; canonical filenames + redaction process documented in `project_tour_page_refresh_sop.md`).

**Backlog items the founder can pick from tomorrow:**

4. **Phase 6 Clawless gateway tap** (RPC spec in memory `project_openclaw_llm_rpc.md`, ~4-6 hours; adds a `clawless` provider that routes LLM calls through the OpenClaw gateway).
5. **Detached sidecar for Telegram bot** (the "magic" v1.4+ feature: bot survives app close, ~1 day; PID file + Electron menu changes; spec in memory `project_phase_8c_bidirectional_telegram.md`).
6. **WebhookConfig `telegram_bot_token` field** (from architect review during phase-1-closeout; currently `url` field stores the full Bot API URL for telegram webhooks, cleaner to add an explicit token field).
7. **Playwright regression test** for the navigate-away-during-debate flow (architect Low-3 from phase-1-closeout review).

**Cross-product follow-ups:**

8. **Bing Search Console** — last check was 2026-05-18 (was Processing). Worth glancing to confirm sitemap flipped to Success.
9. **WhisprDesk SIGTERM root cause** — founder is investigating his own launch script; he may come back with a fix that doesn't need our involvement, but worth a status check.

### First moves when picking up tomorrow

1. **Check inbox.** `mcp__claudelink__read_inbox`. Late messages from Global Sites Developer or iLoveMD developer may have landed.
2. **Verify dev stack is OFF** (`ps aux | grep TradingAgents | grep -v grep`). Should be empty.
3. **Founder's morning queue** — whatever's top of mind. Per founder's wrap message, "we will pick up tomorrow on the app itself" — so likely an item from the desktop app backlog (Phase 6 Clawless tap is the largest queued sprint; smaller items from the v1.1 review backlog above are also fair game).
4. **Optionally:** check Bing Search Console + delete the merged Phase 8c branches if founder's comfortable.

### Earlier this week (2026-05-17) — Phase 1 closeout sprint: 14 commits merged to main, v1.0 shipped

A massive single-day sprint. Founder's brief at the start: "close phase 1 by end of day today." Result: shipped, reviewed, merged to main.

**Headline: `bd94ea0` is the merge commit on `origin/main`.** 14 commits across desktop renderer + Electron main + Python engine + e2e tests + docs, all reviewed independently by two sub-agents (code-reviewer + architect) before merge.

**What landed (in feature order, not commit order):**

1. **Phase 8b multi-ticker batch runner on Watchlist.** New `desktop/src/components/BatchRunner.tsx` + new shared `desktop/src/lib/run-analysis.ts` helper. Sequential per-ticker debate, each one fires its own webhooks naturally, first cost-block aborts the whole batch.
2. **Settings → About Legal & Disclaimers link** (three external links to website /legal pages).
3. **8s AbortController timeout on `getSession`** in engine-client.ts (guards History detail view).
4. **15s AbortController timeout on `testLLMConnection`** (added pre-merge per code-reviewer H2).
5. **"Test connection" button per LLM provider row.** New `POST /llm/test` engine endpoint + 6 mocked pytests + renderer button + inline result.
6. **Window-state persistence to `<userData>/window-state.json`** via new `desktop/electron/window-state.ts`.
7. **Em-dash scrub across all user-facing renderer strings** (Settings, App, DebateStream, StatusStrip, UpstreamCheckModal, Watchlist, History) per the universal style rule.
8. **Analyze.tsx refactor: ~180 lines of inlined request-assembly swapped for the shared `runAnalysis` helper.** ProviderConfig resolution + Alpaca data + CostGuard reservation + webhooks all delegated.
9. **Telegram webhook UX: split URL field into Bot Token + Chat ID.** Renderer extracts / constructs the Bot API URL at storage boundaries. Engine + WebhookConfig schema unchanged.
10. **Navigate-away WS survival.** Founder discovered mid-day: starting a debate then clicking Watchlist/History killed the engine stream. Fix: asymmetric routing in App.tsx — Analyze stays mounted (`display: contents/none`), other pages still mount/unmount. Founder verified.
11. **BatchRunner unmount cleanup + mount-guard** (pre-merge fix per code-reviewer H1).
12. **`tal:session-complete` dispatch moved INTO `runAnalysis`** (pre-merge fix per architect Med1 — caught a regression I introduced in the refactor that left the StatusStrip spend pill stale post-debate).
13. **`{kind: 'no_provider'}` dead-code variant dropped** from RunAnalysisResult union (pre-merge per code-reviewer M5).
14. **Backlog updated**: Phase 8a/8b marked done, Phase 8c (bidirectional Telegram) queued with full spec.

**Independent review workflow used (worth re-using):**

Spawned two parallel sub-agents on Sonnet before merge:
- `coderabbit:code-reviewer` for line-level issues — flagged 10 (2 High, 5 Medium, 3 Low)
- `general-purpose` agent in architect framing — flagged 6 (1 Med + 5 Low, plus forward-compat notes for Phase 6 + 8c)

Triaged with founder, fixed 3 pre-merge blockers, queued the rest as v1.1 backlog. Memory: `feedback_independent_review_pattern.md`.

**Cross-product coordination today:**

- **Clawless Advisor** answered two architecture questions:
  - Phase 6 LLM-proxy RPC spec: `sessions.create` → `chat.send` (deliver:false) → poll `sessions.history`, one long-lived `tal-debate-runner` agent per conversation. Memory: `project_openclaw_llm_rpc.md`. Phase 6 itself queued as 4-6hr v1.1 sprint.
  - Phase 8c bidirectional Telegram: outbound long-polling pattern (engine polls `getUpdates`), zero internet exposure, allowlist per chat_id, per-day cost cap. ~4-5 days for feature parity. Memory: `project_phase_8c_bidirectional_telegram.md`. Don't start before Phase 6 stabilises.
- **iLoveMD developer** asked for cross-family footer link info. Replied (FYI, no reply needed) with brand naming rule + sibling list + family-wide SEO rule. He'll add tradingagentslab.ai to iluvmd.com footer; we owe iluvmd.com on our footer (queued for tomorrow).
- **Clawless Site Developer** confirmed brand naming locked overnight: "Trading Agents Lab" three words for readable text, compressed "TradingAgentsLab" for URL/code only. Memory: `project_brand_naming.md`. Already CLAUDE.md §3 locked.

**Site updates this afternoon:**

- **Bing Webmaster Tools verified** via `public/BingSiteAuth.xml` (site commit `f2ac440`). Sitemap submitted at `tradingagentslab.ai/sitemap.xml` after founder corrected initial submission (had pasted the verification file URL by mistake — Bing's sitemap is the actual `/sitemap.xml`). Bing status: Processing (slow cadence is normal).
- **Google Search Console** sitemap submitted: success immediately, indexing should appear in days. Verification method founder set up separately on his end.
- **Robots.txt + sitemap.xml verified correct** — sitemap excludes the three legal pages per family-wide SEO rule; robots.txt allows all + references the sitemap.

### Live state at session end

- **Desktop dev stack: FULLY KILLED at wrap.** Founder noticed two dock icons (two stale Electron mains from my mid-day restarts during testing) — killed both + vite + engine. Zero TAL processes running. Port 5173 free. If picking back up tomorrow, start fresh: `npm --prefix desktop run dev` from `/Users/junaidsiddiqi/Projects/TradingAgents/`.
- **`main` is at `bd94ea0`** — pushed to origin. Founder smoke-tested phase-1-closeout in dev mode and confirmed the navigate-away fix before authorising merge.
- **`phase-1-closeout` branch still exists** locally and on origin. Safe to delete (`git branch -d phase-1-closeout && git push origin --delete phase-1-closeout`) at founder's call; common convention is to wait a few days then prune.
- **Site at `41d5551`** on origin/main, Cloudflare auto-deployed. Bing verification + sitemap submitted, processing. Google sitemap submitted, success. AI/AEO bundle (robots.txt explicit Allows + llms.txt) landed in wrap-up extension.

### Open items carried into tomorrow

**Quick wins (~30 min each):**
1. **Add iluvmd.com to TAL site footer.** iLoveMD developer asked, I queued it. `components/layout/Footer.tsx` line 51-53 area. Anchor text: "iLoveMD" (single word, matches our pattern). Same external-link wrapper as other siblings.
2. **Delete merged `phase-1-closeout` branch** if founder is comfortable (local + remote).

**v1.1 backlog items from independent reviews (queued, not started):**
3. **History page should listen for `tal:session-complete`** event to auto-refresh during batch runs (architect Low-1). Now possible since runAnalysis dispatches the event.
4. **Playwright regression test** for the "navigate away during analysis, come back, debate still alive" flow (architect Low-3). Currently only the code comment defends against future routing-refactor regressions.
5. **`sweepOrphanEngines` PID-file fix in e2e fixtures** (architect Low-2, code-reviewer L3). Current `pkill -f` kills the founder's dev engine whenever tests run. Real architectural fix is engine-runner.ts writing a PID file to userData, fixture kills by PID not by pattern.
6. **WebhookConfig `telegram_bot_token` field** (architect Low-4). Currently `url` field stores the full Bot API URL even for Telegram entries (renderer constructs it). Cleaner: add explicit `telegram_bot_token` to the schema. Do before Phase 8c extends the schema.

**Bigger v1.1 sprints (each needs its own day):**
7. **Phase 6 Clawless gateway tap.** RPC spec captured in memory. ~4-6 hours of focused Python WebSocket adapter work. Adds a `clawless` provider to PROVIDER_PRIORITY.
8. **Phase 8c bidirectional Telegram bot.** Architecture captured in memory. ~4-5 days for feature parity (1-2 day MVP). Outbound polling, allowlist, per-day cost cap, detached sidecar. Don't start before Phase 6 stable.

**Search Console follow-up:**
9. **Check Bing Webmaster Tools tomorrow morning** — sitemap should have flipped from Processing → Success overnight, URLs discovered should jump from 0 to ~22 (1 home + 5 marketing + 16 docs). **Heads-up from Global Sites Developer:** Bing's "last crawled" sentinel was at WCF MinValue (never actually crawled) at their audit time tonight. May self-resolve. **If still stuck Wednesday (~48hr from now), remove + resubmit the sitemap on Bing.**
10. **Check Google Search Console tomorrow morning** — first indexing pass results should appear; ranking takes days to weeks.
11. **IndexNow key file shipped tonight** on site repo as `1134928`. Curl-verified live at `https://tradingagentslab.ai/3d1551480f673d723f74adc750803f34c6648127b61d321ccfa33f780713ab66.txt`. Family-wide shared key per Global Sites Developer coordination. No tomorrow action required; bots discover the key via DNS / by submission. Note: this is the foundation for future PUSH-based URL submission to Bing + Yandex (one call notifies all engines that consume IndexNow).

**Pre-existing items unchanged from earlier wraps:**
11. **OG image generation** — Clawless Site Dev's Python+PIL script still queued.
12. **Stage 2 monetization research dispatch** — 5 queued questions in `project_monetization_roadmap.md`; awaits founder go.
13. **Stage 2 build itself** — gated on Apple Developer cert approval (~2 weeks).

### First moves when picking back up tomorrow

1. **Check inbox.** `mcp__claudelink__read_inbox`. iLoveMD developer may have followed up. Clawless Advisor or other agents may have pinged.
2. **Verify dev stack is OFF** (`ps aux | grep TradingAgents | grep -v grep`). Should be empty. If founder wants to use the app, `npm --prefix desktop run dev`.
3. **Check Bing + Google Search Console** for sitemap status flip + any URL discovery issues.
4. **Founder's morning queue** — whatever's top of mind. If nothing specific, the iluvmd.com footer add is the smallest unfinished item; Phase 6 Clawless tap or Phase 8c Telegram bot are the biggest next sprints.

### Yesterday and earlier — compressed back-reference

For context on em-dash rule, brand-naming lock, "wrap-up" trigger formalisation, website build day, monetization roadmap → see Handover history (this section was full of detail before the v1.0 closeout overwrote it). Memory files in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-junaidsiddiqi-Projects-TradingAgents/memory/` hold the durable locked decisions.
5. **Optional: OG image generation, Stage 2 research dispatch** — only on founder's explicit go.

### Yesterday (2026-05-16) — website-build day + org transfer + monetization roadmap (compressed)

This was the biggest single-session arc since Phase 0. Three threads:

**1. Marketing + docs website built end-to-end and shipped live.**
- Repo: `RBJGlobal/TradingAgentsLab-Site` (local path: `/Users/junaidsiddiqi/Projects/Trading_agent_site/`)
- Live URLs: `https://tradingagentslab.ai` (canonical) + `https://tradingagentslab.com` (301 → .ai)
- Stack: Next.js 15 App Router + React 19 + Tailwind v4 CSS-first + TypeScript strict + static export → Cloudflare Pages dashboard Git integration (no GH Actions)
- Personality: dark `#0d1117` + warm amber `#f0a830` + JetBrains Mono headings — "Bloomberg Terminal translated to the web". Distinct from RBJ Global (cream/serif), Clawless (B&W), WhisprDesk.
- 31 static routes: hero, how-it-works, about (with RBJ Global parent hierarchy callout), security, download, docs index, 16 KB doc pages synced from `docs/kb/` via `scripts/sync-docs.sh`, three legal pages.
- Cross-product coordination: WhisprDesk dev provided full stack handoff + LinkedIn CTA pattern. Clawless Site Dev provided OG image script (queued — PNG not yet generated). rbjglobal.com now has parent-site coverage for TAL on homepage / products / about + JSON-LD subOrganization+sameAs arrays.
- Independent senior-level audit (CodeRabbit code-reviewer + general-purpose architect) → 3 blockers + 1 high all fixed in `a26c0a4`. Medium-priority follow-ups cleared in `a4abc5b`.
- 10 commits on `RBJGlobal/TradingAgentsLab-Site` main, all pushed.

**2. Both repos transferred from `jaysidd` to `RBJGlobal` org.**
- `RBJGlobal/TradingAgentsLab` (this repo, the desktop+engine)
- `RBJGlobal/TradingAgentsLab-Site` (the marketing site)
- All hardcoded `jaysidd/TradingAgentsLab` URLs swept and committed (`738c42f` here, multiple on the site). User-Agent / OpenRouter HTTP-Referer / Help menu / Settings → About all updated.
- Local git remotes already repointed for both repos.
- GitHub auto-redirects keep old URLs working but canonical references match the new home now.

**3. Stage 1 / 2 / 3 monetization roadmap locked into memory.**
- See `~/.claude/projects/-Users-junaidsiddiqi-Projects-TradingAgents/memory/project_monetization_roadmap.md` — comprehensive, includes Lemon Squeezy plan, license enforcement design (compile-time `TAL_BUILD_MODE` env-var gate, NOT obfuscation), explicit rejection of the Clawless-mirror close-source path, full Stage 2 launch sequence triggered by Apple Developer cert approval (~half-day work once started; Clawless team will pour the architecture pattern into TAL via ClaudeLink).
- Source stays fully open on GitHub even after Stage 2. Paying customers buy convenience (signed installer + license activation + support), not source access. AGPL-3.0 stance unchanged.
- Founder bio on /about: explicitly deferred to ~2-3 weeks (post-LLC + post-Apple-cert). See `project_founder_bio_deferred.md`.

### Live state at session end

- Desktop dev stack STILL RUNNING — founder is regression-testing. Engine sees Alpaca + OAuth + gpt-5.4 traffic on the wire. Do NOT kill on tomorrow's session start without confirming.
- If founder closed the window between sessions: bring it back up with `npm --prefix desktop run dev` from `/Users/junaidsiddiqi/Projects/TradingAgents/`.

### Open issue still unresolved — Settings page blanks in dev mode

Carried from yesterday's wrap. Untouched today (website build consumed the day). Founder may have hit it during tonight's regression testing — check inbox + first-thing tomorrow.

### 🟡 Open issue from tonight — Settings page blanks in dev mode

Founder reported "Settings is opening a blank black page" during a live spin of the Phase 8a build. Confirmed details:
- Production build (Playwright e2e) — Settings renders all 6 tabs correctly, 6/6 tests pass
- Dev mode in Electron — blank
- Vite serves Settings.tsx successfully (HTTP 200); no compile errors in the dev log
- Type-check clean, build clean

Most likely a runtime exception thrown during Settings render that React swallowed. Next-session first-action: open DevTools in dev mode (Cmd+Opt+I), click Settings, capture the Console error. Likely culprits to check first (no proof yet, just where I'd look):
- The new `WebhooksTab` import chain — `desktop/src/lib/webhooks.ts` imports `getSecret/setSecret/deleteSecret` from `./secrets`. Verify those names still exist (they do per earlier grep). Verify `crypto.getRandomValues` works in renderer.
- The inline `import('./webhooks').WebhookConfig[]` type reference in `engine-client.ts` could be tickling a Vite HMR edge case.
- Settings.tsx default tab `'llm'` → could be the LLM tab itself failing now, not Webhooks.

Production was already pushed (`3480ee8`) at founder's "push now, we'll roll back if needed" call. If users hit the same blank Settings, rollback path is `git revert 3480ee8 && git push origin main` — clean, no history rewrite. Or hide just the Webhooks tab by deleting the TabDef entry — keeps engine + dispatcher live.

### Today's headline (2026-05-16)

- **Phase 8a webhooks** shipped + pushed. Telegram/Slack/Discord/Generic presets, per-receiver filter, HMAC for generic, no broker presets (positioning firewall). Webhook URLs treated as secrets end-to-end (never logged, never in WS events, never in History replay).
- **"The Diligence" brand name** chosen for the multi-agent process. Trademark-able single word. Captures the institutional "due diligence" meaning. Memory locked at `project_diligence_brand_name.md`. Three UX touches landed (uncommitted, will push tomorrow after the Settings bug is sorted): Analyze subtitle, streaming badge ("Diligence" not "Streaming"), progress footer ("Diligence complete in 54s").
- **Settings blank-page bug** surfaced during the spin. Pushed Phase 8a anyway at founder's call. Investigation queued for tomorrow.

**Phase 8a — Webhooks v1.** Engine dispatcher (`engine/webhooks.py`) fires HTTP POST to user-configured receivers after `session.complete`. Four presets:
- **Telegram** — bot API; renders short Markdown summary with ticker/action/confidence/reasoning. User configures URL + chat_id.
- **Slack** — incoming-webhook URL. Posts text-only summary.
- **Discord** — webhook URL. Posts text-only summary.
- **Generic JSON** — full decision schema (`tradingagentslab.webhook.v1`) with optional HMAC-SHA256 signature sent as `X-TAL-Signature`.

Filter per receiver: action allowlist (BUY/SELL/HOLD) + min confidence. Empty filter = fire on everything. Settings → Webhooks tab manages add/edit/delete. Post-debate report card in DebateStream shows fire/filter/fail status per receiver — URLs NEVER displayed (Telegram URLs contain bot tokens).

**Security posture (load-bearing):**
- Webhook URLs are secrets — stored in safeStorage, never logged, never echoed in `webhook.report` event (so they never end up in persisted History).
- Engine dispatcher uses asyncio.gather + 5s per-receiver timeout. No retry queue in v1 — failures are reported and the user re-runs if they care.
- Locked positioning maintained: no broker presets shipped. Users who want broker bridging write their own Cloudflare Worker / Lambda receiving the Generic payload and calling their broker's API with their own credentials.

**Verification:**
- 17 new pytests in `engine/tests/test_webhooks.py` (payload shape per kind, HMAC math, filter logic, error mapping, parallel dispatch, URL-leak guard)
- 1 new Playwright test (`webhooks.spec.ts`) — Settings round-trip add → save → reopen
- 134/134 engine pytests · 6/6 Playwright · dev-smoke 17/17 · type-check + build clean

What it does:
- 5th pill in StatusStrip ("Spend") shows daily $ vs daily cap with green/amber/red colour states. Polls `/cost-guard/state` every 30s plus a 500ms-delayed re-poll on `tal:session-complete` (closes the race vs engine's finalize_reservation SQLite UPDATE).
- Engine yields a new `cost.usage` event after every `agent.message` carrying running token totals + USD estimate. `free=true` for OAuth subscription + local-LLM runs (both bill at $0 — pill inlines "subscription" / "on-device" instead of a static zero).
- History page gains a sort dropdown (Most recent / Most expensive / Ticker A-Z), choice persisted in localStorage. Per-row cost was already there; this surfaces it sortably.
- 4 new pytests + `docs/api.md` cost.usage shape added.
- 117/117 engine pytests · `dev-smoke.sh` 17/17 · type-check clean.

### Previous day's commits (already pushed 2026-05-14 evening)

```
36fbcb8  docs: 2026-05-14 end-of-day wrap — 8 commits + daily-driver context
25bd7e3  feat(analyze): streaming progress strip — phase chips + agent counter + live clock

1094865  feat(icon): Trading Agents Lab app icon — amber compass on dark navy
1abf604  fix(local-llm): model picker on Analyze + accept auth_kind=local in cost-guard
206027f  docs: refresh Handover.md + WORKLOG.md for 2026-05-14 overnight session

6d514e8  feat: sentiment_analyst grounded in StockTwits + Reddit (port from upstream)
2ab4be1  feat: local LLM support (Ollama / LM Studio / generic OpenAI-compat)
```

Headline arcs:
- **Local LLM support end-to-end** — Ollama / LM Studio auto-detect, Settings UI, model picker on Analyze, $0 CostGuard path. Founder daily-tested with 3 Ollama models.
- **Sentiment_analyst port from upstream** (`0fcf136`) — StockTwits + Reddit pre-fetch grounds the sentiment_analyst in real social data instead of fabricating. Asset-class-aware subreddit routing.
- **App icon end-to-end** — amber compass on navy, distinct from Clawless (green C) so multiple Electron windows in the dock are distinguishable. PNG + multi-resolution `.icns`. Dock tooltip + Force Quit name patched via Info.plist postinstall script.
- **Streaming progress strip** — phase chips + agent counter + live elapsed clock in DebateStream. Founder signed off ("Looks great. I like it.").
- **KB sweep** — 4 new pages (local-llm, cost-guard, crypto-tickers, sentiment).

### Verification at end-of-day

- 113/113 engine pytests pass
- `bash tools/dev-smoke.sh` 17/17
- `npm --prefix desktop run type-check` clean
- Live UI tested: local LLM debate with model dropdown, new icon visible in dock, progress strip animating through all 4 phases
- Dev stack cleanly stopped (no orphan processes at session end)

### Strategic context (for the morning)

- Founder is daily-driving the app for the next ~2-3 weeks while waiting for LLC + Apple Developer Program registration.
- Phase 7b launch prep is correctly gated on that — by the time LLC lands, daily-driving will have surfaced real UX issues to fix first.
- Suggested workflow: founder keeps notes during daily use; triage them in priority order at the end of the cycle.

### First moves when picking back up

1. **Review the 8 commits.** `git log --oneline -8`. Each commit message is self-explanatory; WORKLOG.md 2026-05-14 has the full session report.
2. **Push when ready:** `git push origin main` pushes all 8 at once. Held off per CLAUDE.md §4.
3. **Resume daily-driving** OR pick from the work queue below.

### What's pending (next-session candidates, priority order)

1. **Phase 8b — multi-ticker batch runner.** "Analyze all" button on Watchlist that sequentially runs each ticker through the existing single-ticker stream. Engine doesn't change; renderer just queues. Each debate fires its own webhook naturally. Plus optional summary webhook at the end ("3 of 5 BUY") for Telegram daily-driver use. ~half-day.
2. **Phase 6 Clawless gateway tap** — founder-prioritized. Routes LLM calls through Clawless gateway. ~1-2 days; probe already proven (`tools/clawless-probe.mjs`).
3. **Phase 8a webhooks** — ✅ DONE 2026-05-15.
4. **Playwright UI tests** — ✅ DONE 2026-05-15. 6 tests run in ~25s via `npm --prefix desktop run test:e2e`.
5. **CostGuard 6/6 polish** — Spend pill ✅ shipped 2026-05-15. Remaining: background TTL sweep cleanup of stale reservations (engine side, low priority — TTLs already expire, this just GC's the rows).
6. **Phase 7b launch prep** — blocked on LLC + Apple Developer Program (~2-3 weeks).

## Previous state (as of 2026-05-09 end-of-day — comprehensive update)

### Major shipping milestones since the previous Handover

- ✅ **CostGuard end-to-end** — engine math + 4 HTTP endpoints + renderer modal + Settings tab. TOCTOU-safe, OAuth-aware ($0 path), 3-second anti-tamper override. (`0b3bc20` → `3ccbd05`)
- ✅ **Phase 5b Alpaca data adapter** — auto-routed when keys configured, hard-coded `data.alpaca.markets` (locked positioning safety). Free Basic-tier compatible. (`146933d`)
- ✅ **Crypto support proper path** — `engine/ticker.py` normalization, AlpacaProvider `_crypto_quote_summary` via `/v1beta3/crypto/us/bars`, yfinance crypto branch, asset-class-aware fundamental_analyst prompt, `asset_class` on the wire, Crypto badge on Data card. (`0ff70e3`, `517d99d` for yfinance crypto news fallback)
- ✅ **Compact StatusStrip** at app shell (28px row, visible on every page, replaces 4 bulky cards on Analyze) — frees prime real estate for the debate output. (`fbf226a`)
- ✅ **SEC-aware disclaimer tightening** — three-tier system (footer / inline below decision card / page-level full text). Memory: `project_disclaimer_language.md`. (`b8e395c`)
- ✅ **Locked positioning** — analysis only, no execution code in public repo, ever. Removed Settings → Broker tab. Memory: `project_positioning_analysis_only.md`. (`5d73d7c`)
- ✅ **Strategic posture (this commit)** — free OSS, zero data collection, Clawdemy.org integration, public-repo-never-includes-broker-code, launch-prep gating items. Memory: `project_risk_profile_and_education.md`. README + CLAUDE.md updated.
- ✅ **App display name** "Trading Agents Lab" (3 words) on user-facing surfaces — macOS app menu, window title, header, footer, brand. (`e96bb30`, `b8e395c`)
- ✅ **Engine logging upgrade** — `[ws] OPEN/CLOSE`, `[alpaca]`, `[yfinance]`, `[yfinance fallback]` log lines for live-tail visibility during testing.
- ✅ **Upstream-check tool** — `tools/upstream-check.sh` + weekly cadence rule in CLAUDE.md. We're at upstream/main HEAD (2 commits past v0.2.4 already in tree).
- ✅ **CORS fix** for PUT preflight that was blocking Settings → Cost Guard saves. (`43bd8df`)
- ✅ **Universal green Connected pill** on every SecretRowItem (was only OAuth + yfinance). (`d8fb196`)

### Strategic posture lock-ins (memory; load-bearing)

- `project_positioning_analysis_only.md` — analysis-only, no execution code in public repo, webhooks for external broker handoff
- `project_risk_profile_and_education.md` — free OSS, no monetization, Clawdemy.org case study, zero data collection, launch-prep gating items
- `project_disclaimer_language.md` — three-tier disclaimer copy locked, banned/approved phrasing for AI-washing risk
- `project_alpaca_data_tier.md` — free Basic tier sufficient; never ship features requiring Algo Trader Plus
- `feedback_handle_restarts_yourself.md` — engine kill / dev-server cycle done autonomously; founder has no spare terminals

### Verification at end-of-day

- 100 engine tests pass (cost_guard 36 + cost_guard_api 15 + ticker 17 + alpaca_provider 15 + others)
- `bash tools/dev-smoke.sh` 17/17
- `npm --prefix desktop run type-check` clean
- `npm --prefix desktop run build` clean
- Live UI verified across NVDA, AAPL, CRCL, BAC (equities) + ETH, ADA, DOGE (crypto) end-to-end
- Founder's Alpaca Basic-tier credentials confirmed working for both stocks and crypto endpoints

### Live state at session end

- Dev stack PID 96112 (engine) + Electron + Vite still running for any morning testing
- Kill cleanly with: `pkill -f "engine/.venv/bin/python -m engine"; sleep 1; pkill -TERM -f "TradingAgents.*electron"; sleep 2; pkill -f "TradingAgents.*\.bin/vite"`
- 18 commits ready to push (founder authorized end-of-day push)

### Done — Phase 0 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5p1 → Phase 2.1-light → SQLite + History + Watchlist

**Day 1 (2026-05-07):** Phases 0, 1, 2 + license setup.

**Day 2 (2026-05-08), three autonomous blocks (~13 feature commits, founder away):**

Block 3 (Phase 2.1-light + storage + UI):

- ✅ **Phase 2.1-light: real-LLM debate** (`75d020e`). `engine/live_debate.py` ships a sequential per-agent OpenAI loop with role-specific prompts mirroring upstream. Cost-capped (`max_tokens=400`, 12 agents, gpt-4o-mini default, ~$0.005/session estimate). When `provider_config` is absent in the WS start frame, the path falls through to the canned stub unchanged. Session.complete now carries `live`, `model`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `estimated_cost_usd` on live runs.
- ✅ **SQLite session storage + parallel KB** (`7dbbeff`). `engine/storage.py` versioned-schema layer at `<repo>/data/sessions.db`, write-on-stream-end, `GET /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{id}`, `DELETE /sessions/{id}`. Best-effort writes never fail the stream. Plus 11-file user-facing knowledge base in `docs/kb/` built by a parallel sub-agent (Sonnet) — getting-started, how-it-works, configuring-llm-providers, data-providers, clawless-connector, reading-the-debate, keyboard-shortcuts, security-and-storage, troubleshooting, faq + index.
- ✅ **History page** (`d736e6e`). List + detail of persisted debates. Race-guarded against rapid row clicks via generation counter. Reuses `DebateStream` for detail view. Copy transcript markdown.
- ✅ **Watchlist page + cleanup** (`4b88894`). SQLite-backed tickers, deep-link to Analyze via `desktop/src/lib/handoff.ts`. Deleted dead `ComingSoon` component now that all four routes have real pages.

Block 2 (Phase 4 main + news + menu + tooling):

Block 1 (~4 commits):

- ✅ **Phase 3** — renderer ↔ engine wired end-to-end (`c5815fa`). Click "Analyze NVDA" → 17-event debate streams in over ~7s → decision card.
- ✅ **Phase 4 spike** — Settings page + hash router (`e716d86`). All tabs visible, `Configure` buttons disabled, phase-guard explains.
- ✅ **Phase 5 part 1 — yfinance data integration** (`5273904`). Real NVDA data flows: $211.50 last close, +19.38% over 24 sessions, 147M avg volume.
- ✅ **Phase 5 polish** (`de030ee`). Stop button while streaming. Data status card flips to "yfinance · live". Copy transcript (Markdown) action.

Block 2 (~4 commits, this run):

- ✅ **Phase 4 main — secret storage + Settings UI wiring** (`f3b9543`). safeStorage-backed (no native deps), versioned JSON schema, hard-fails on no encryption available, never re-displays stored values. About tab shows the `<userData>/secrets.json` path so founder knows where the encrypted blob lives.
- ✅ **News headlines via yfinance** (`a984179`). `GET /data/news` endpoint, `news.headlines` WS event before debate, news_analyst stub now bullets real Yahoo Finance headlines, renderer surfaces a linked News card, transcript export includes news section.
- ✅ **Keyboard shortcuts + Electron app menu** (`0de893a`). Real menu bar with mac-aware structure. Cmd+N (new analysis), Cmd+. (stop), Cmd+, (settings), Cmd+1/2/3 (nav). Page-level Cmd+Enter (run) on Analyze.
- ✅ **Tooling + docs** (`be6d12d`). `tools/dev-smoke.sh` runs 8 backend assertions for fresh-session verification (verified 8/8 pass). `docs/api.md` is the new engine API contract doc — indexed in `CLAUDE.md` doc graph. Date input maxes at today.

See `WORKLOG.md` for the chronology with verification details per commit.

**Verification gap:** every commit passed `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`, and `tools/dev-smoke.sh` against the live backend. **No UI click-through was performed** — autonomous blocks didn't drive Electron via Playwright. First action on return is a manual smoke (see "What founder should do first when they return" below). If the UI fails, run `bash tools/dev-smoke.sh` first to rule the backend out — that script verifies the entire engine contract end-to-end.

### Tomorrow's autonomous block (founder pre-authorized — token budget for the week)

Founder explicitly gave runway for the next session: *"do not worry about tokens, I have enough tokens for this week. You can wrap up cost analysis and budget, do testing, do some testing with playwright."* Queue, in priority order:

1. **CostGuard + budget caps.** Full Clawless Advisor pattern in hand (~600 LoC service shape, TOCTOU reservation pattern, IPC surface, modal override UX, global-not-per-provider budgeting). Extension for stacked daily/weekly/monthly caps + rate-cap dimension for OAuth (since OAuth `usage.cost === 0` means cost-cap is meaningless — rate cap on session count is what matters there). **Founder's directive:** *"When user is using OAuth, you do not want to calculate cost. It's going to be zero. When user is using API, if model selection is via API, then you collect token cost."* — `OpenAICodexAdapter` already returns `(content, in_tokens, out_tokens)` with subscription-routed sessions naturally producing `cost === 0`, so the policy slots in cleanly.
2. **Playwright + Electron testing.** Set up `playwright/test` with Electron driver. Add UI smoke tests covering: provider dropdown switches, model dropdown updates per provider, manual override persists across reloads, OAuth Connect-row state changes correctly, debate stream renders. Closes the "UI not click-tested autonomously" gap that's been a footnote on every commit this run.
3. **JWT plan-tier detection** in `oauth-openai.ts`. Decode the OAuth access JWT at receive time, extract `https://api.openai.com/auth.chatgpt_plan_type`, store alongside credentials. Surface a banner if free-tier (Codex routing is unreliable on free per Clawless Advisor's B34 incident). Small, defensive, ~30 min.
4. **Reviewer pass on the model picker** (commit `c81b1d0`) — skipped in the rush; queue for follow-up cleanup of any caught issues.

### Open questions queued for founder (answer when back, then I unblock)

Decisions I deferred during this run. The three from the previous block that I *did* act on (your blanket authorization covered them) are noted at the bottom. None are blocking what shipped; they're blocking *what comes next*.

1. **Multi-provider order.** Phase 2.1 ships OpenAI only. Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenRouter wiring lands next — but you pasting a key for one specific provider first lets me ship one targeted commit (with cost table + correct auth shape) instead of a megacommit for all four. Which one do you actually have a key for?
2. **"Test connection" button.** Still holding. Now that real-LLM lands, this is a meaningful UX win (don't burn quota on a typo'd key) — but it still costs ~1 cheap request per test. Add it now with explicit-trigger + warning, or after multi-provider so each provider's test path is wired in one go?
3. **OpenAI OAuth flow.** Same gating as before. Scaffold now or wait until you've used the API key path enough to know if OAuth is worth the complexity?
4. **Secrets export / import.** Speculative without your machine-migration story. Do you want a Settings → About "Export encrypted secrets" / "Import on new machine" pair? If yes, what's the threat model — same machine recovery, or actual cross-machine portability?
5. ~~**Phase 5 part 2: Alpaca data + broker.**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-05-09:** locked positioning (CLAUDE.md §3 + memory `project_positioning_analysis_only.md`) removes the broker work entirely. Replaced by Phase 5b (data-only Alpaca, see backlog) and Phase 8 (webhooks for external broker handoff, see backlog). Alpaca Markets keys now live under Settings → Data Providers, configured for `data.alpaca.markets` only.
6. **Phase 6: Clawless gateway tap.** Probe (`tools/clawless-probe.mjs`) is the working reference. Worth wiring before or after multi-provider? It changes the LLM transport, so logically belongs in the same area as Phase 2.1.

**Acted on with blanket authorization (today's run):**

- All four API-key providers wired (`8a9526b`): OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Google Gemini.
- **OpenAI OAuth shipped** (`ed35277` + `9a09d08`) via `@earendil-works/pi-ai`. Subscription-routed via `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` (Codex backend), not `/v1/chat/completions`. Verified end-to-end with founder's account: first successful live debate using OAuth + gpt-5.4.
- Per-provider model picker (`c81b1d0` + `2cfa560`): two dropdowns in header, per-(provider, auth) localStorage memory, recommended pre-selection. Codex model list mirrors founder's actual ChatGPT picker.
- DeepSeek removed from Settings.

**Still externally blocked:**

- **Phase 5b (Alpaca data adapter)** — Alpaca Markets keys now stored in Settings → Data Providers; engine adapter for `data.alpaca.markets` is the next discrete unit. Broker work removed per locked positioning 2026-05-09.
- **Phase 6 (Clawless tap)** — could start anytime; deferred behind cost-guard + playwright per founder priority.
- **Subscription-routing verification** — first OAuth debate succeeded; you should check your OpenAI billing dashboard to confirm the run did NOT add to your API tier (i.e., that the Codex/subscription path is actually billing through your ChatGPT plan, not per-token).

### Most natural next priorities (founder picks)

1. **Phase 7b launch-prep** — Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, brochure marketing site at tradingagentslab.com, signed DMG distribution. Backlog has the breakdown. Requires founder direction on jurisdiction + scope; engage securities counsel for the disclaimer review before public launch.
2. **KB sweep** — add docs/kb pages for crypto symbols, Alpaca data, Cost Guard. Existing pages still mostly current.
3. **Playwright UI tests** — was originally planned today; deferred for the strategic-posture work that emerged. Closes the "UI not click-tested autonomously" gap that's been carried since the autonomous block days.
4. **Phase 6 Clawless gateway tap** OR **Phase 8 webhooks** — both pending; founder's call which feels more valuable next.
5. **Streaming progress UX** — backlog item from this morning for a phase chip + completion badge in DebateStream (improves the "is it still running?" perception during 60-90s gpt-5.4 debates).

### Domain bookings (founder action)

- `tradingagentslab.com` — defensive must-have, ~$12/yr, canonical
- `tradingagentslab.ai` — brand alignment for AI/LLM positioning, ~$70-90/yr
- Skip `.io` (`.ai` has eclipsed it for AI projects)

### What founder should do first when they return

1. **Pull latest:** `git -C /Users/junaidsiddiqi/Projects/TradingAgents pull` (commits will be on origin/main).
2. **Read `WORKLOG.md`** for the chronological session report and `backlog.md` for the punch-list-style "what's done / what's left."
3. **Smoke-test Phase 3 end-to-end** with the actual UI:
   ```bash
   npm --prefix /Users/junaidsiddiqi/Projects/TradingAgents/desktop run dev
   ```
   Wait for the window to open. Engine status card should flip from "Starting…" to "Running" (green dot) within 2-3s. Click **Analyze** with default ticker `NVDA`. Expect: 17 events stream in over ~7s, ending with a decision card showing **HOLD** at **55%** confidence. Cmd+Q to close when done.
4. **If Phase 3 looks good**, the next discrete chunks are: Phase 4 (settings + keychain — needs founder's API keys to integrate fully), Phase 2.1 (replace stub with real `tradingagents` core — needs decision on first LLM provider), or Phase 5 (yfinance/Alpaca data + paper-trading broker).

### Currently blocked

- (none) — Phase 3 done; Phase 4 spike runway depends on whether the agent reached it before the founder's return (see WORKLOG.md).

### Pending external / deferred

- 🟣 OpenClaw upstream PR adding `client.id: "tradingagentslab"` constant — non-blocking; `"cli"` works today
- 🟣 Massive.com / Polygon-class data provider — deferred until a feature requires it
- 🟣 Distribution + auto-update — Phase 7
- 🟣 No outstanding ClaudeLink threads to Clawless Advisor

## Architectural decisions (locked in)

- **Desktop:** Electron + React + TypeScript (chosen for our own needs, not to inherit Clawless code)
- **UI:** Built from scratch. Independent theme — compatible with Clawless ecosystem aesthetic but no shared CSS or components
- **Engine:** Python 3.13 sidecar wrapping `tradingagents` core, FastAPI on `127.0.0.1` (HTTP + WebSocket)
- **LLM:** BYO keys default. Optional Clawless gateway tap routes through `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` (validated). Anthropic API key only — **no Anthropic OAuth** (TOS-banned).
- **Protocol source of truth:** OpenClaw npm package TypeScript types (MIT, public). Do NOT reverse-engineer Clawless's gateway-client.ts.
- **Data:** yfinance default (free), Alpaca optional (paid, founder's choice). Massive.com deferred.
- **Broker:** ~~Alpaca paper trading default.~~ **REMOVED 2026-05-09 per locked positioning.** TradingAgentsLab is an analysis tool, not an execution platform. External broker integration via outbound webhooks (Phase 8) — users execute on their own authorized brokerage account.
- **Storage:** SQLite + OS keychain for secrets.
- **Marketing:** "Standalone trading companion for Clawless." Never "extension/plugin/add-on."

## Verified protocol facts (Clawless / OpenClaw gateway)

- URL: `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` · Auth: token in `connect` request params
- Frame envelope: `{type: "req"|"res"|"event", id (string), method, params}` (NOT JSON-RPC)
- Protocol version: running gateway speaks `3`. Docs say `4`. Adapter must negotiate `min/maxProtocol`.
- Schema constraints: `client.id: "cli"` works (custom IDs rejected). `client.mode: "ui"` works (`"operator"` rejected on protocol 3).
- Token grants broad read access (full agent inventory + session history visible). Treat as high-value secret — store via OS keychain only.

See `tools/clawless-probe.mjs` for working reference protocol code.

## Conventions / non-obvious things to know

- **Cost discipline:** Founder is on a weekly Opus 4.7 quota. When spawning sub-agents, use Sonnet 4.6 or Haiku 4.5. Reserve Opus for the parent (Claude conversation owner). See `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_subagent_models.md`.
- **Cross-product channel:** For questions about Clawless desktop / OpenClaw, message `Clawless Advisor` via ClaudeLink (`mcp__claudelink__send`). Do NOT try to read Clawless's repo directly — harness blocks scope escalation outside `~/Projects/TradingAgents/`.
- **No upstream PRs (yet):** Founder explicitly does not plan to upstream changes to TauricResearch. AGPL-3.0 fork is for personal/commercial enhancement under his own terms.
- **Sister-product theming:** Trading desktop must look like a Clawless family member when launched alongside it. Same fonts, same color tokens, same background.

## Where to pick up next session

The full first-moves checklist is above under **"First moves on the next (post-reboot) session"**. Ground truth:

- **Phases 0/1/2 are done.** Don't redo them.
- **Phase 3 is the next deliverable.** Wire the renderer to the engine sidecar so clicking "Analyze NVDA" streams the canned 16-event debate into the UI. Detailed file plan above.
- **Confirm with founder before pushing.** Architecture is settled, but the founder may have new direction after reboot.
- **Read memory before acting:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-junaidsiddiqi-Projects-TradingAgents/memory/` contains durable context. The `MEMORY.md` index lists everything.
- **Clawless/OpenClaw questions:** message `Clawless Advisor` via ClaudeLink (`mcp__claudelink__send` to role `Clawless Advisor`). Register first as `trading-agents-lab` if not already registered. Frame requests with "no Clawless team work needed" to respect their pre-launch sprint.
