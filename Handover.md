# TradingAgentsLab — Handover

> **Purpose:** Session-to-session context bridge. If you (Claude or human) are picking this up cold, read this first. Status by phase in [`backlog.md`](backlog.md). Chronological session log in [`WORKLOG.md`](WORKLOG.md). Detailed design in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). Orchestration rules in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## What this project is

**TradingAgentsLab** — github.com/jaysidd/TradingAgentsLab. AGPL-3.0 fork of Tauric Research's TradingAgents (multi-agent LLM trading research framework). Positioned as the **"standalone trading companion for Clawless"**.

**Connection, not integration.** TradingAgentsLab connects to Clawless the same way it connects to Alpaca or Yahoo Finance — one of N optional connectors. **No code inheritance from Clawless.** No shared CSS, no copied components. Brand-level coherence achieved through independent design.

**Posture:** open-source educational lab + paper trading. Never recommend real-money trading.

**Owner:** Junaid Siddiqi, founder. Treats Claude as principal developer/architect for TradingAgentsLab.

## Where we are right now (as of 2026-05-08 — Phase 3 shipping)

### Session in progress

- ✅ Founder rebooted machine cleanly (yesterday's wrap-up worked — `e527632` on origin/main)
- ✅ Registered as `trading-agents-lab` developer on ClaudeLink
- ✅ Phase 3 shipped — renderer ↔ engine wired end-to-end (see Phase 3 entry in `WORKLOG.md` and `backlog.md`)
- ⏳ Continuing into Phase 4 spike (settings page scaffolding) per advisor green-light for unsupervised stretch scope
- ⏳ Founder away ~4-5 hours; report on return

### Done — Phase 0 → Phase 3 + Phase 4 spike + Phase 5 part 1 + polish

**Yesterday (2026-05-07):** Phases 0, 1, 2 + license setup.

**Today (2026-05-08), autonomous block (~4 commits, founder away):**

- ✅ **Phase 3** — renderer ↔ engine wired end-to-end (`c5815fa`). Click "Analyze NVDA" → 17-event debate streams in over ~7s → decision card.
- ✅ **Phase 4 spike** — Settings page + hash router (`e716d86`). All tabs visible, `Configure` buttons disabled, phase-guard explains. No keytar yet (gated on founder go).
- ✅ **Phase 5 part 1 — yfinance data integration** (`5273904`). Real NVDA data flows: $211.50 last close, +19.38% over 24 sessions, 147M avg volume. Analyst messages quote real numbers. `GET /data/summary` + `data.summary` WS event. Falls back gracefully on data failure.
- ✅ **Phase 5 polish** (`de030ee`). Stop button while streaming. Data status card flips to "yfinance · live". Copy transcript (Markdown) action after session.complete.

See `WORKLOG.md` for the full chronology with verification details per commit.

**Verification gap:** the four commits passed `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`, and full backend smoke (curl + node WebSocket). **No UI click-through was performed** — the autonomous block didn't spin up Electron Playwright. First action on the next session is a manual smoke (see "What founder should do first when they return" below).

### What founder should do first when they return

1. **Pull latest:** `git -C /Users/junaidsiddiqi/Projects/TradingAgents pull` (commits will be on origin/main).
2. **Read `WORKLOG.md`** for the chronological session report and `backlog.md` for the punch-list-style "what's done / what's left."
3. **Smoke-test Phase 3 end-to-end** with the actual UI:
   ```bash
   npm --prefix /Users/junaidsiddiqi/Projects/TradingAgents/desktop run dev
   ```
   Wait for the window to open. Engine status card should flip from "Starting…" to "Running" (green dot) within 2-3s. Click **Analyze** with default ticker `NVDA`. Expect: 17 events stream in over ~7s, ending with a decision card showing **HOLD** at **55%** confidence. Cmd+Q to close when done.
4. **If Phase 3 looks good**, the next discrete chunks are: Phase 4 (settings + keychain — needs founder's API keys to integrate fully), Phase 2.1 (replace stub with real `tradingagents` core — needs decision on first LLM provider), or Phase 5 (yfinance/Alpaca data + paper-trading broker).

### Currently blocked

- (none) — Phase 3 done; Phase 4 spike runway depends on whether the agent reached it before the founder's return (see WORKLOG.md).

### Pending external / deferred

- 🟣 OpenClaw upstream PR adding `client.id: "tradingagentslab"` constant — non-blocking; `"cli"` works today
- 🟣 Massive.com / Polygon-class data provider — deferred until a feature requires it
- 🟣 Distribution + auto-update — Phase 7
- 🟣 No outstanding ClaudeLink threads to Clawless Advisor

## Architectural decisions (locked in)

- **Desktop:** Electron + React + TypeScript (chosen for our own needs, not to inherit Clawless code)
- **UI:** Built from scratch. Independent theme — compatible with Clawless ecosystem aesthetic but no shared CSS or components
- **Engine:** Python 3.13 sidecar wrapping `tradingagents` core, FastAPI on `127.0.0.1` (HTTP + WebSocket)
- **LLM:** BYO keys default. Optional Clawless gateway tap routes through `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` (validated). Anthropic API key only — **no Anthropic OAuth** (TOS-banned).
- **Protocol source of truth:** OpenClaw npm package TypeScript types (MIT, public). Do NOT reverse-engineer Clawless's gateway-client.ts.
- **Data:** yfinance default (free), Alpaca optional (paid, founder's choice). Massive.com deferred.
- **Broker:** Alpaca paper trading default. Live trading gated behind explicit user confirmation per marketing posture.
- **Storage:** SQLite + OS keychain for secrets.
- **Marketing:** "Standalone trading companion for Clawless." Never "extension/plugin/add-on."

## Verified protocol facts (Clawless / OpenClaw gateway)

- URL: `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` · Auth: token in `connect` request params
- Frame envelope: `{type: "req"|"res"|"event", id (string), method, params}` (NOT JSON-RPC)
- Protocol version: running gateway speaks `3`. Docs say `4`. Adapter must negotiate `min/maxProtocol`.
- Schema constraints: `client.id: "cli"` works (custom IDs rejected). `client.mode: "ui"` works (`"operator"` rejected on protocol 3).
- Token grants broad read access (full agent inventory + session history visible). Treat as high-value secret — store via OS keychain only.

See `tools/clawless-probe.mjs` for working reference protocol code.

| `.env` | Local secrets (gitignored). Contains `CLAWLESS_GATEWAY_*` and LLM provider keys. |

## Conventions / non-obvious things to know

- **Cost discipline:** Founder is on a weekly Opus 4.7 quota. When spawning sub-agents, use Sonnet 4.6 or Haiku 4.5. Reserve Opus for the parent (Claude conversation owner). See `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_subagent_models.md`.
- **Cross-product channel:** For questions about Clawless desktop / OpenClaw, message `Clawless Advisor` via ClaudeLink (`mcp__claudelink__send`). Do NOT try to read Clawless's repo directly — harness blocks scope escalation outside `~/Projects/TradingAgents/`.
- **No upstream PRs (yet):** Founder explicitly does not plan to upstream changes to TauricResearch. AGPL-3.0 fork is for personal/commercial enhancement under his own terms.
- **Sister-product theming:** Trading desktop must look like a Clawless family member when launched alongside it. Same fonts, same color tokens, same background.

## Where to pick up next session

The full first-moves checklist is above under **"First moves on the next (post-reboot) session"**. Ground truth:

- **Phases 0/1/2 are done.** Don't redo them.
- **Phase 3 is the next deliverable.** Wire the renderer to the engine sidecar so clicking "Analyze NVDA" streams the canned 16-event debate into the UI. Detailed file plan above.
- **Confirm with founder before pushing.** Architecture is settled, but the founder may have new direction after reboot.
- **Read memory before acting:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-junaidsiddiqi-Projects-TradingAgents/memory/` contains durable context. The `MEMORY.md` index lists everything.
- **Clawless/OpenClaw questions:** message `Clawless Advisor` via ClaudeLink (`mcp__claudelink__send` to role `Clawless Advisor`). Register first as `trading-agents-lab` if not already registered. Frame requests with "no Clawless team work needed" to respect their pre-launch sprint.
