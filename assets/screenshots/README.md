## Capture spec (for future refreshes)

- **Window size:** ~1280×800 — crisp on retina, fits GitHub README cleanly
- **Theme:** dark — the v1 brand signature is warm amber on `#0d1117`. Don't capture in light mode
- **Format:** PNG. JPEG compression artefacts on dark UI screenshots look bad
- **Privacy:** if you'd rather not publish your real OAuth email, blur it or replace with `you@example.com` before saving. The plan tier ("plus plan", "pro plan") is fine to show — it's a feature
- **Naming:** lowercase-hyphenated, descriptive. `analyze-form.png` not `Screenshot 109.png`. The README image references depend on these exact filenames staying stable

## When refreshing screenshots

1. Open the running app (Cmd+Q + restart if needed for clean state)
2. Capture the relevant page with Cmd+Shift+4 + space (window capture on macOS, gives you a clean PNG)
3. Save to this directory with the canonical filename above (overwrite)
4. Commit with a message like "docs: refresh analyze-decision.png to show <new feature>"
5. The README's image references pick up the new file automatically — no edit needed
