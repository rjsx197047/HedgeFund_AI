"""Phase 2.1-light: real-LLM debate with sequential per-agent calls.

This is intentionally *not* a wrapper around upstream's LangGraph. We pull the
spirit of the upstream agent roles (their system prompts, their phase
structure) but call the model directly with our own minimal orchestration.
The full upstream-graph integration is a later phase; the simpler approach is
controllable, debuggable, and stays under the founder's quota.

Cost discipline (non-negotiable, enforced HERE not in adapters):
- Total agents per session is bounded by `MAX_AGENTS_PER_SESSION = 12`
- `max_tokens` per agent message is capped to whatever `ProviderConfig` carries
  (which is itself capped by `_MAX_TOKENS_HARD_CAP` in `llm_providers.py`)
- Estimated cost per session is logged to stderr after `session.complete`

Rough budget per session at defaults (gpt-4o-mini, 400 tokens): ~7,400 input
tokens (each agent gets the prior turns appended) + ~2,400 output tokens
≈ ~$0.005 USD. Other providers in `llm_providers._COST_PER_M_TOKENS`.

When a provider key is not configured, the module is not invoked at all —
the WS path falls back to the canned `stub_debate.canned_debate` instead.
Multi-provider support: see `llm_providers.LLMAdapter` for the Protocol +
implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Gemini).
