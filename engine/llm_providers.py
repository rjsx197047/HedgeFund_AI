"""LLM provider adapters for the live debate path.

Each adapter exposes the same minimal Protocol so `live_debate.py` can call
any provider without per-provider branching. Cost caps (`max_tokens`,
`MAX_AGENTS_PER_SESSION`) are enforced by `live_debate.py`, not here —
adapters cannot accidentally raise them.

Today's allowlist: `openai`, `anthropic`, `openrouter`, `gemini`, `xai`,
`minimax`, `local`.
OpenAI also has a sibling `OpenAICodexAdapter` for the OAuth/subscription
path that hits `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` instead of the
standard chat-completions endpoint — the factory picks based on
`config.auth.type`. The `local` provider is the generic OpenAI-compatible
adapter for runtimes like Ollama and LM Studio; the base_url comes from
the renderer at session time so any localhost runtime works.

Cost rates are local approximations refreshed manually. They are budgeting
hints for the founder, never billing records — providers update prices
quarterly and this table will drift. **Subscription-billed routes
(OpenAI Codex / OAuth) are NOT per-token billed**; the engine's logged
cost estimate overstates true cost for OAuth sessions. The founder's
billing dashboard is the source of truth.

# ---- OpenAI Codex adapter (OAuth / ChatGPT-subscription path) -------------


class OpenAICodexAdapter:
    """OpenAI Codex Responses API — the path that routes through the user's
    ChatGPT subscription instead of their per-token API tier.

    OAuth tokens issued by `loginOpenAICodex` are NOT API tokens. Attaching
    them as `Authorization: Bearer …` to the standard `/v1/chat/completions`
    endpoint hits the user's API quota, not their subscription (founder
    smoke-tested this 2026-05-09 and got `insufficient_quota` 429).

    Subscription routing requires a different endpoint:

        URL: https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses
        Headers: Authorization: Bearer <oauth_access>
                 chatgpt-account-id: <accountId from oauth credentials>
                 originator: pi
                 User-Agent: pi (...)
        Body: OpenAI Responses-API shape (`input` not `messages`,
              `instructions` not `system` role, etc.)

    This adapter implements the same `LLMAdapter` Protocol as the
    `OpenAIAdapter` (Chat Completions, API key) but talks to the Codex
    backend. The factory `adapter_for(config)` picks one or the other based
    on `config.auth["type"]`.

    Replicates the request shape pi-ai (@earendil-works/pi-ai/oauth) uses
    for Clawless desktop's OAuth path. The header set + body shape is taken
    directly from `openai-codex-responses.js` `buildBaseCodexHeaders` and
    `buildRequestBody`.

    Cost note: when a session runs through this adapter, the founder is
    NOT being billed per-token — the cost is amortized into their ChatGPT
    subscription. The cost-estimate the engine logs on session.complete is
    technically wrong-direction (overstates) for OAuth runs. We don't try
    to "fix" that with a $0 calculation; the founder's billing dashboard
    is the source of truth.
