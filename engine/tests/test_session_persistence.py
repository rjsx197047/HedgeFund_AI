"""Tier 2 session persistence tests.

Covers the shared helper that bridges the WS and Telegram-bot debate paths
into a single `sessions` table write. Two surfaces, one ledger.

The motivating regression: bot-triggered debates were never writing to
`sessions`, so a debate that outlived its 15-min reservation TTL silently
dropped its cost from the global spend ledger (sweep marks the reservation
finalized=NULL before finalize_reservation runs, then there's nothing in
the sessions table to recover the actual cost from). The fix routes both
paths through `storage.write_session_from_events`.
