"""Catalog-consistency guards (added 2026-05-28 after the provider audit).

These tests prevent the *internal* drift that the May 2026 audit flagged as
the top structural risk: the model catalog now lives in several parallel maps
(engine ``_DEFAULT_MODELS`` / ``_COST_PER_M_TOKENS`` / ``_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS``
and the renderer's ``PROVIDER_MODELS`` picker), and nothing stopped them from
silently disagreeing. The concrete failure they catch:

  A model is offered in the renderer picker (or set as a provider default) but
  has no row in ``_COST_PER_M_TOKENS`` -> CostGuard reserves $0 for it (the
  "unknown model" path) -> the per-run budget cap silently can't see its cost.

What these tests do NOT catch is *vendor* staleness: a model ID that is
internally consistent here but has been deprecated or renamed by the provider
(e.g. xAI retiring grok-4-fast-* on 2026-05-15). That class of drift is caught
by the periodic upstream check (``tools/upstream-check.sh``) and audits like
the one that produced this file, not by a unit test. Layered defense:
consistency test (here) + upstream check + periodic audit.
